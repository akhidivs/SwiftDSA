# Data Structures in Swift

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of common data structures implemented using the **Swift programming language**. The repository aims to help developers and learners understand the core concepts of various data structures, their real-world applications, as well as their performance characteristics. The goal is to provide both theoretical insights and practical Swift implementations for each data structure.

## Introduction

In computer science, **data structures** are a way of organizing and storing data so that they can be accessed and modified efficiently. Understanding how different data structures work, their performance trade-offs, and when to use them is essential for any software engineer.

In this repository, each data structure is accompanied by:

- **Theory and explanation**: A description of how the data structure works.
- **Applications**: Where the data structure is typically used in the real world.
- **Advantages and Disadvantages**: Key points about the strengths and weaknesses of the data structure.
- **Swift Implementation**: A working example of how the data structure can be implemented in Swift.
- **Interview Questions**: Common questions related to the data structure that may appear in technical interviews.

## Data Structures Included

This repository includes the following data structures:

- **Arrays**  
- **Linked Lists (Singly and Doubly Linked Lists)**  
- **Stacks**  
- **Queues**  
- **Trees (Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree)**  
- **Heaps (Min-Heap, Max-Heap)**  
- **Graphs (Adjacency List, Adjacency Matrix)** 
- **Priority Queue** 

Each data structure is accompanied by a detailed explanation and Swift code implementation.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

Here's a summary of the trade-offs of some common data structures:

| Data Structure | Advantages |	Disadvantages |
|:---------------|:-----------|:--------------|
| Array          |	Fast access by index, simple implementation	Fixed size | inefficient insertions/deletions |
| Linked List	   | Efficient insertions/deletions, dynamic size |	Slow access, extra memory for pointers |
| Hash Table     |	Fast lookup, insert, and delete operations |	Poor worst-case performance (hash collisions) |
| Binary Search Tree (BST) |	Fast search, insert, delete (O(log n)) |	Unbalanced trees lead to O(n) performance |
| Graph	         |Great for networks, complex relationships |	Complex to implement and manage |
